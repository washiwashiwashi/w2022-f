Engineering materials
====
This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2022.

## Introduction
Our team is "Otemon Curiocity. There are two people in our team.
* Akimitsu Fujimura/Programmer robot designer
* Masamu Yasui/Programmer 

## About the Robot
* This self-driving car is mainly made by LEGO, and parts that are not available in LEGO are created using a 3d printer.

## The hardware
| what to use | Details |
|:---|:---:|
| LEGO spike prime | To run automatic cars |
| BBC microbit | To process image recognition |
| Huskylens | To recognize traffic signals |
| RGB LED | To communicate between microbit and spike |
| LED | To increase the recognition rate of huskylens traffic signals |
| L motor | Rear wheel motors |
| M motor | To be used in steering |

## The software
Since this robot uses spike and microbit, the language is a visual language. spike uses the LEGO® Education SPIKE™ app, MakeCode for micro:bit, and downloads the program.The programs is in `src`.

## The good thing about this robot
1.The robot has a simple structure and the system is not that complicated,
The system is not that complicated, and it is not difficult to deal with any problems.
2.When a part breaks down, it can be fixed with LEGO, rather than having to go to the trouble of remaking the main part with a 3d printer.
