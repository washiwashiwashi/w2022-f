The robot is controlled by LEGO spike prime (henceforth spike) and BBC microbit (henceforth microbit), and object recognition is done by I2C communication between huskylens and microbit. In the case of SPIKE, the program is downloaded by using the LEGO® Education SPIKE™ app and connecting the microUSB cable. For microbit, we use Microsoft MakeCode for micro:bit and download the program via microUSB cable.
